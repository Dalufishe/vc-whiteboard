## Introduction

This is a WIP tool that try to visualize scrolls and fragments data information on a endless whiteboard.

## Usage

Download [this folder](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaohsiao123/vc-whiteboard) and then run a localhost server on it (e.g. python server). Currently has some camera control issue on Windows, so it's more recommended to use Mac for now. Once you open the application, you can press `Enter` + `Click` to generate a card on the whiteboard. In the current application, we try to visualize the region along segment `20230509182749`.

## Notes

There are still many bugs in this version, so if you encounter difficulties in using it, feel free to contact me directly. Will see is there anywhere that I can help, thanks!
